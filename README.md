# Demo001
This is a demo project that I am using to develop an understanding of Entity Framework v6. The Demo001 project will create a set of static lists that will be used in other apps for displaying things like the list of states in the US, Canada and Mexico. It has the ability to use EF Code First to create and populate the database tables. Works well with Sql Server but not so much with the Oracle database.
